                        <h3>Whatsapp Cloan </h3>
                        <p>I have developed a project that clones the functionality 
                            of WhatsApp using Java, Java Swings, and networking.
                             Although the specific details of your project are not 
                             provided, I can give you an overview based on the technologies
                              I have mentioned. My WhatsApp clone is a chat 
                              application that allows users to communicate with 
                              each other in real-time over a network. 
                              You have used Java as the primary programming 
                              language for developing the backend logic of the
                               application. Java Swings have been used for creating 
                               the user interface of the application, providing a smooth
                                and interactive experience for the users.To enable real-time
                                 communication between users, I have implemented 
                                 networking functionality in my project. This would
                                  involve setting up a server that manages the 
                                  communication between different clients (users) and
                                   handles the transfer of messages between them.
